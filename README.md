# creditsUntilGraduation
An extremely simple program where you enter the college credits (semester) that you've earned. 
Ideally, the program will give you the green light if you've earned 120 or more credits.
If not, it will tell you how many courses you have left after answering a few short questions.

Just an experiment from my early days in learning Python.
